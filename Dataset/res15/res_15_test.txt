the $T$ came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it
waitress

i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table

she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables
